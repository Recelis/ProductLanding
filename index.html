            <h2>Ownership is over-rated.</h2>
            <p>The World is Becoming more about subscribing vs ownership. Subscribing means it's cheaper, there is more flexibility for when you want to quit, 
                no contracts to lock you in, and no ownership over a product or a service that you may not need when your business changes.

            <h2>See the Different Types of Subscription</h2>
            <p>Consultants will typically help you choose whether to adopt a Curated Box vs a Specific Item Subscription model. We will help you look
                at all of the different things a subscription based consultant may look at and help you decide on who best to subscribe to.
